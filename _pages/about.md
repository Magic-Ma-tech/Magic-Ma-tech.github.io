Welcome, my name is Ma Binhao. I am set to graduate in June 2024 with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [South-Central Minzu University](https://www.scuec.edu.cn/). I already have plans to pursue a Ph.D. while completing my Master's degree. 

I am a highly self-driven student who, during my graduate studies, self-taught machine learning and developed a strong interest in artificial intelligence security. I have published three SCI papers and have one more currently under review. I aspire to continue learning and improving. In my future doctoral studies, I hope to make even better and more impactful contributions, aiming for publications in top-tier conferences. 

My research focus is on Artificial Intelligence Security and Privacy. Therefore, I am currently looking for a Ph.D. program in Artificial Intelligence Security and Privacy for the autumn of 2024.
